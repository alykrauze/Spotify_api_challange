# project1

Project Description: 
Applied Spotify APIs to gather data, created Python Databases to store the data, and used MatPlot lib to create graphs with an analysis on audio features of tracks and similarities between different artists.

Questions Asked: 
●Are the ‘Audio Features’ of tracks within a curated playlist similar?
●Popularity Comparison between related artists & does their range in genre affect their popularity? 
●How popular is Doja Cat’s music? 
●How does a Doja Cat song change throughout the duration of the song?
